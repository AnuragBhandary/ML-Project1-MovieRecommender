# Made a movie recommendation system using Python.
Movie Recommendations are mainly of three types : Content Based, Collaborative Filtering and Hybrid. In this project I've used Content Based Recommendation. 
I used the bag of words model, stemming and finally cosine similarity to recommend the movies most similar to the input movie.
The database I used was from the TMDB 5000 movies dataset from Kaggle.
I used Streamlit to make the fronted user interface, and Jupyter to code the backend.
